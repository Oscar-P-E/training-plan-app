            Foundational: Consistency and some kind of progressive overload.
            Without these, you're not going to get anywhere. In particular
            consistency cannot be stressed enough. If you just get these down,
            you'll get better results than 90%+ of people at the gym. Countless
            meatheads have gotten massive by just pushing themselves consistenty
            for 5-10 years. Countless intelectuals have studied the intricacies
            of exercise science, and yet have nothing to show for it because
            they enjoy studying working out more than they do actually working
            out. You should be prepared to sacrifice anything else except
            consistency. For example, if added complexity, days of training,
            time in the gym, volume, annoying to set-up movements, etc. are
            going to make you less consistent, then don't do those things.
            Squats make you want to skip the gym? Don't squat. Think of it like
            this: if some modification would make the routine 1% or even 10%
            more effective, but would kill you, then it's not really more
            effective. If you think you can only do 30 minutes, 3 days a week,
            then do that. You won't turn into Ronnie Coleman, but you' be
            surprised how far you can get. On the other hand, if you
            inconsistently try to do something more "optimal", you'll get the
            results that most people in the gym get, because that's what 90%+ of
            the people in the gym are doing. Remember the number 90%. You need
            at least 90% adherence to your workout plan and diet if you want to
            be successfull. If you want to debate the 90% number, then I don't
            know what to say to you.

            Important: I believe the best way to promote hypertrophy is to get
            stronger in a moderate rep range (around 10 rep max). Lifting
            weights at any rep range makes you stronger. When you train, you
            become neuromuscularly adapted to the movement patterns you're
            performing, at the average rep range you're performing them at. Make
            no mistake, bodybuilders are strong. Their strength is just
            optimised for a higher rep range. What we typically call "strength
            training" is neuromuscular efficiency at a low rep range.
            "Powerlifting" is strength training, optimised for a 1 rep max, in
            the squat, bench and deadlift using the most advantageous legal
            technique for the lifter possible. That being said, I believe the
            best way to train for strength is to train for hypertrophy first,
            and low rep strength later. This is because larger muscles have mroe
            strength potential than smaller muscles. Therefore we build the size
            of the engine before we optimise its performance.

            Less important: Periodised training is more effective than training
            that is not periodised, simply because it takes advantage of short
            term adaptations. If we have just come off from a break, or are new
            to lifting, we are sensitive to training and therefore do nnot need
            much volume or intensity to make progress. However, as we adapt to
            training, we need more volume and intensity to continue making
            progress. Periodised training takes advantage of these adaptations
            by starting with low volume and intensity, and gradually increasing
            them over time. This is the basic idea behind periodisation. There
            are many different ways to periodise training, but the basic idea is
            the same. If we did not periodise training, we would fatigue
            ourselves in the beginning much more than we need to, for pretty
            much the same progress as if we had started with less volume and
            intensity, and then as we adapt, we would need to increase volume
            and intensity to continue making (as good) progress. Note that
            periodisation is not essential. It is just slightly more optimal
            that not periodising. It is also much more complex though, so if it
            makes you less consistent, then don't do it. Periodisation ranges
            from almost completely unimportant for a beginner, to almost
            completely essential for a world class athlete. If you're a
            beginner, just focus on consistency and progressive overload.
