          Keep it simple (I just want a simple plan that will give me some good
          gains.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Suitable for my level and circumstances (Recommended. Added complexity
          that would only give marginal benefits at your level of development
          will be avoided.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Make me the most optimal program possible (Warning: Not recommended
          for new or beginner lifters because you will get the same results
          doing a simple program. I will dictate most aspects of the training
          and you will be given very little ability to customise.)
