        <li>Beginner - you have experience and maybe also some gains.</li>
        <li>
          Intermediate - a few years of consistent lifting and people can
          definitely tell you lift. You're not able to make gains as fast as you
          used to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advanced - if you have to ask if you're advanced, you're not advanced.
          If the typical 1 week deload doesn't fully recover you and you're
          struggling to make gains, even though you train hard, you might need
          to move on to some advanced training.
